warc3-wet: Python3 library to work with WARC and WET files
==============================================

Note: This is a fork of the original (now dead) warc repository.

WARC (Web ARChive) is a file format for storing web crawls.

http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/ 

This `warc` library makes it very easy to work with WARC files.::

    import warc
    with warc.open("test.warc") as f:
        for record in f:
            print(record['WARC-Target-URI'], record['Content-Length'])

And WET files.::

    import warc
    with warc.open("test.warc.wet") as f:
        for record in f:
            print(record['WARC-Target-URI'], record['Content-Length'])

Documentation
-------------

The documentation of the warc library is available at http://warc.readthedocs.org/.

Apart from the install from pip, which will not work for this warc3 version, the
interface as described there is unchanged.
